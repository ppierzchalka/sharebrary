# Book Library Page Design - Sharebrary

## Overview

Design a modern, visually appealing book library page that allows users to browse, search, and filter through the collection of ebooks. This page should showcase books in an engaging masonry layout while providing robust filtering and search capabilities.

## Brand Context

- **App Name**: Sharebrary
- **Primary Colors**: Blue (#3b82f6) and green (#10b981)
- **Typography**: Modern, clean sans-serif (Inter)

## Layout Requirements

### Header

- Standard Sharebrary navigation bar should be present
- Page title "Library" should be prominent
- Search bar for searching books by title, author, or description

### Filtering Sidebar (Left Column)

- Category filter section with expandable categories and subcategories
- Tag filter section with popular tags displayed as interactive badges
- Sort options dropdown (Newest, Most Popular, Alphabetical)
- Clear filters button
- Filter apply/reset buttons for mobile view
- Visual indication of active filters

### Main Content Area (Right Column)

- Masonry grid layout for book cards
- Responsive grid that adjusts columns based on screen width
- Loading state for when books are being fetched
- Empty state design for when no books match filters
- Pagination controls at the bottom

### Book Card Design

- Consistent aspect ratio for all book covers
- Book cover image as the focal point
- Book title (limited to 1-2 lines with ellipsis)
- Author name
- Small tag chips (limited to 2-3 tags)
- Short description preview (2-3 lines with ellipsis)
- Subtle hover effect to indicate interactivity
- Loading skeleton state for cards while content is loading

### Pagination Component

- Page number indicator
- Previous/Next buttons
- Visual indication of current page
- Disabled state styling for unavailable navigation options

## Interaction Notes

- Book cards should be clickable, leading to book detail page
- Category and tag selections should immediately update the filter UI
- Filter application should trigger a visible loading state
- Search should include debounce functionality to prevent excessive API calls
- Clicking a tag in a book card should apply that tag as a filter
- Scroll position should be maintained when applying filters
- Consider infinite scrolling as an alternative to pagination

## Filter Interaction Flow

1. User selects category/tag/search term
2. Visual feedback shows selection
3. Filter pill appears in an "Active Filters" section
4. Book grid updates with loading state
5. Results appear with count/summary
6. User can remove individual filters via the filter pill or clear all

## Responsive Considerations

- On mobile devices, filters should collapse into an expandable drawer or modal
- Book grid should adjust from 4 columns (large desktop) to 1 column (mobile)
- Search bar should collapse into an expandable search icon on smaller screens
- Filter visibility toggle for smaller screens

## Special Requirements

- Dark/light theme versions with appropriate contrast for book cards
- Accessibility considerations for filter interactions
- Empty states for various scenarios (no books, no search results)
- Loading states for initial load and filter application
- Smooth transitions when filtering changes the book grid
- Visual indication when a book has already been added to favorites or downloaded

## Data Display Needs

- Support for various book cover aspect ratios
- Handling of missing images (placeholder design)
- Tag color coding system (optional)
- Character count limitations for titles and descriptions
