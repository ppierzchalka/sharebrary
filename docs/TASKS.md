# Sharebrary Tasks

This document provides an overview of the tasks required to implement the Sharebrary application.

## Task Structure

Each task has been organized into its own detailed document with implementation steps, code examples, and dependencies. This structure allows for more maintainable documentation and easier tracking of progress.

## Task List

### Core Setup and Infrastructure

1. [Project Setup](./tasks/01-project-setup.md) - Setting up the Nx monorepo with Next.js, Firebase, and TailwindCSS
2. [White Labeling](./tasks/02-white-labeling.md) - Implementing theme customization and branding capabilities

### User Management

3. [Authentication System](./tasks/03-authentication.md) - Implementing user authentication with Firebase, including login/registration flows
4. [User Management](./tasks/04-user-management.md) - Building user profile management and admin approval functionality

### Library Features

5. [Book Library Core](./tasks/05-book-library.md) - Creating the core book display, browsing, and viewing functionality
6. [Book Upload System](./tasks/06-book-upload.md) - Implementing book upload, metadata extraction, and processing
7. [PDF Viewer](./tasks/07-pdf-viewer.md) - Building an in-browser PDF viewer for book previews
8. [Search and Filtering](./tasks/08-search-filtering.md) - Enhancing the search and filtering capabilities

### Social Features

9. [Comments and Ratings](./tasks/09-comments-ratings.md) - Implementing book reviews, comments, and rating system
10. [User Collections](./tasks/10-user-collections.md) - Building personal book collections, favorites, and reading history

### Analytics and Optimization

11. [Analytics Dashboard](./tasks/11-analytics-dashboard.md) - Creating analytics for administrators and insights for users
12. [Performance Optimization](./tasks/12-performance-optimization.md) - Optimizing loading times, caching, and overall performance

## Progress Tracking

Each task in the documents above includes a checklist of detailed implementation steps. You can use these checklists to track progress on each task.

## Implementation Approach

For efficient development, the following approach is recommended:

1. Complete the core setup tasks first (1-2)
2. Implement authentication and user management (3-4)
3. Build the core book library features (5-8)
4. Add social features (9-10)
5. Finally, implement analytics and optimization (11-12)

This sequence ensures that each task builds upon completed foundational work, minimizing refactoring and rework.

## Dependencies

Each task document clearly identifies its dependencies on other tasks. Make sure to complete the required dependencies before starting a new task.
